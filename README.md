## üîß Functionalities

Highlighted functionalities encompass:

### User Authentication and Authorization

- **Initial User Creation:** Upon first execution, a 'master' role user is created. This user has the authority to create admin accounts through the `/admin` endpoint.
- **User Account Management:**
  - Creation of user accounts using the `/users` endpoint (POST request).
  - Logging in with user credentials through the `/sessions` endpoint (POST request). Successful login generates a JWT token used for subsequent actions on the routes (handled via middleware).

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Middleware Authorization:**
  - Specific middlewares to validate actions:
    - Middleware to ensure only admins have access to certain routes.
    - Middleware restricting access to the 'master' role user.

### Dish Management

- **Routes for Dish Handling:**
  - `/dishes` endpoint with CRUD operations:
    - `create` (for admins), `update` (admin), `show` (all), `index` (all), `delete` (admin).
  - `/dishes/image` endpoint for image addition and update of dishes (admin access).

### User Interaction

- **Managing Favorites:** Routes under `/favorites`:
  - `create`, `show`, `index`, and `delete` available for all users. Used to save favorites in the database.

### Payment Processing

- **Transaction Handling:**
  - `/transactions` endpoint with a `create` operation available for all. Responsible for payment processing, order creation, status alteration, and utilizes a real payment API (currently set up for test payments with fictitious cards provided by the Mercado Pago API).

### Order Management

- **Order Handling:**
  - Routes under `/orders`:
    - `show` (all), `update` (admin), `index` (admin). Orders are created upon successful payment completion.

## üìÇ Folder Structure and Code Organization

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **/src** - Root directory for source code.
  - **/configs** - Configuration files.
    - `auth.js` - Contains JWT secret keys and expiration time.
    - `upload.js` - Handles file uploads using multer and sets storage destination paths.
  - **/controllers** - Contains controllers handling business logic.
  - **/database** - Database related files.
    - **/sqlite** - SQLite database files.
    - **/knex** - Knex configuration files.
    - **/migrations** - Database migration files.
  - **/master** - Contains specific files related to the 'master' role.
    - **/controllers** - Controllers for the 'master' role.
    - **/services** - Services for the 'master' role.
    - **/repositories** - Repositories for the 'master' role.
  - **/middlewares** - Middleware files for request processing.
  - **/providers** - Files for handling storage providers (like disk storage for images).
    - `diskstorage.js` - Manages image deletion and update functionality.
  - **/repositories** - Repository files for database interactions.
  - **/routes** - Route definitions.
  - **/schemas** - Schema files for data validation or database schema.
  - **/services** - Service files containing business logic.
  - **/utils** - Utility/helper files.
- **/tmp** - Directory to store temporary files (e.g., images).

## üöÄ Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for the project.
- **NodeJS:** The JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
- **Express:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build the API.
- **bcryptjs:** A library for hashing passwords.
- **cookie-parser:** Middleware used for parsing cookies.
- **cors:** A package enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure communication between servers.
- **dotenv:** A module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- **jsonwebtoken:** Used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **knex:** A SQL query builder for Node.js used for interacting with the database.
- **multer:** Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, particularly used for file uploads.
- **sqlite3:** SQLite database driver.
- **mercadopago:** Integration for payment processing through Mercado Pago.
- **yup:** A schema validation library.

### Development Dependencies
- **Jest:** JavaScript testing framework.
- **nodemon:** Development tool for automatically restarting the server on file changes.
- **@flydotio/dockerfile:** Tool for creating Dockerfiles.
- **kill-port:** Used to kill a process currently using a particular port.

These technologies form the foundation of the project, covering server-side development, database interaction, middleware usage, authentication, validation, testing, and development convenience.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Set up necessary environment variables. You can refer to the `.env.example` file for guidance.
4. Start the local server with `npm start` or `npm run dev`.

The `.env.example` file serves as a reference for setting up the required environment variables.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Before proceeding, it's essential to create an admin account using the master credentials to access the application fully.

To create an admin account, utilize a POST request to the `/admin` route. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and follow the API's documentation or guidelines for admin account creation.
